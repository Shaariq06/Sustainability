    <h1>Sustainability while Coding</h1>
    <p1
      >Sustainable practices support ecological, human, and economic health and
      vitality. Sustainability presumes that resources are finite, and should be
      used conservatively and wisely with a view to long-term priorities and
      consequences of the ways in which resources are used. Green coding is an
      environmentally sustainable computing practice that seeks to minimize the
      energy involved in processing lines of code and, in turn, help
      organizations reduce overall energy consumption. Many organizations have
      set greenhouse emission reduction goals to respond to the climate change
      crisis and global regulations; green coding is one way to support these
      sustainability goals. Green coding is a segment of green computing, a
      practice that seeks to limit technology’s environmental impact, including
      reducing the carbon footprint in high-intensity operations, such as in
      manufacturing lines, data centers and even the day-to-day operations of
      business teams. This larger green computing umbrella also includes green
      software—applications that have been built using green coding
      practices.</p1
